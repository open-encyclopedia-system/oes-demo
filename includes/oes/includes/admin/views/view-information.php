        online encyclopaedias in the fields of humanities and social sciences that provide readers worldwide free and 
        unrestricted online access to scientific content (Open Access). OES is a digital framework that hosts a 
        collection of customizable workflow management and editing tools to create, publish and maintain academic 
        reference works. Our claim is to create a system for the users, in which collaboration and editorial workflow 
        management is easy and web-based. The OES software should be customizable, flexible and adaptable to context 
        applications as well as simple to operate. Ultimately, the OES software should set a standard in being a 
        sustainable framework for this type of publications.', 'oes');?>
