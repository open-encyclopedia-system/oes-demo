# Open Encyclopedia System Plugin

Welcome to the Open Encyclopedia System Demo (OES Demo) repository on GitHub. OES is a modular and configurable software for creating, publishing and maintaining online encyclopedias in the humanities and social sciences that are accessible worldwide via Open Access. For more information please visit the main repository or our website.

A typical OES application consists of an OES plugin and an additional OES project plugin which implements the OES features for the application. The OES Demo plugin is an exemplary OES project plugin allowing you to experience an exemplary application. This application includes a basic online encyclopedia and should be used with the OES theme.

## Documentation (Coming Soon)

We are working on a detailed user manual and a technical function reference. Support is currently provided via our email help desk info@open-encyclopedia-system.org. We answer questions related to the OES plugin and its usage.


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

OES Demo depends on the OES Core Plugin:
* OES Core, version 2.2., URL: https://github.com/open-encyclopedia-system/oes-core.

### Installation

1. Download the OES plugin from gitHub and add it to your WordPress plugin directory.
2. Download and activate the dependencies.
3. Activate the OES plugin.
4. Create your OES project plugin or download and activate the OES Demo plugin.
5. (Optional) Download and activate the OES theme.

If the installation was successful you will now see the menu "OES Settings" inside the WordPress admin interface in the navigation menu on the left (as well as custom post types such as "Articles", "Contributors", "Glossary Entries", etc.). Navigate to "OES Settings" / "Data Model" and use the button "Reload from Plugin Config" to import the ACF fields (this will only work if you have admin rights).  The OES Demo and its functionalities are now available inside your WordPress installation.

You can start configuring by exploring the OES settings (documentation coming soon) or editing the model.json inside your project plugin.
